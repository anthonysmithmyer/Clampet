# Clampet

## Project Summary

The objective of this report was to analyze a disk image of a hard drive without having any knowledge on whether or not any crimes were committed. Clampet required the use of multiple Digital Forensics tools, such as Autopsy, Windows Registry Explorer, Windows Event Viewer, etc. in order to write a report summarizing my findings, which could be usable in court.
